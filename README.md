# Bit-Packing

T = 0, S = 3

Coding-style follows through with Rockefeller-defined convention.

A small program made to read a specified amount of bits from a byte array, and return the value as a long. Made for the Rockefeller University. Posted here for portfolio.

NOTE: Did not include header files or makefile. Heavy use of ROCKS library, therfore this exists for demonstration purposes only.
